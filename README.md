# Prediction of heart disease using different Machine Learning Methods

## Project Overview
In pursuit of find a reliable method to determine when a person could have heart disease 
a dataset with various parameters related to heart health was downloaded and several methods of 
Machine Learning were applied to it, in order to determine their reliability, the accuracy of each one was computed.

## Skills used in this project
* Data visualization using Python
* Logistic Regression
* Naive-Bayes method
* K-Neighbors classifier
* Support Vector classifier
* Decission Tree Regression
* Confusion Matrixes
* Accuracy Calculation


## Understanding the data
The dataset contains multiple columns with information about the patients


* Age : Age of the patient [years]
* Sex : Sex of the patient[1:Male, 0:Female]
* cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type
  * Value 1: typical angina
  * Value 2: atypical angina
  * Value 3: non-anginal pain
  * Value 4: asymptomatic
* trtbps : resting blood pressure [in mm Hg]
* chol : cholestoral fetched via BMI sensor [in mg/dl] 
* fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) [1 = true; 0 = false]
* rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results [values 0,1,2]
* thalach : maximum heart rate achieved 
* exang : exercise induced angina [1 = yes; 0 = no]
* oldpeak : ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
* slope : the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
* ca: number of major vessels [0-3] colored by flourosopy
* thal : heart rate
    * Value 0: normal
    * Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
    * Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
* target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack

## Data Exploratory Analysis

The relation between positive cases of heart disease and the age of each person shows
